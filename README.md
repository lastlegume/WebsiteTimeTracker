An extension that tracks where you spend your time on the web and when you spend that time. Data for the current day and all time is visible when the extension icon is clicked. Data for the previous day, last week, month, and average day is also visualized in graphs.

Makes use of Chart.js to create visually appealing charts to visualize the data collected. Updating to a non-persistent background script and a port to Google Chrome are planned for the future.
